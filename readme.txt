CiviCRM Groups Sync keeps Contacts in CiviCRM Groups in sync with WordPress Users in Groups provided by the Groups plugin.



== Description ==

CiviCRM Groups Sync keeps Contacts in CiviCRM Groups in sync with WordPress Users in Groups provided by the [Groups plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/groups/).

### Requirements

This plugin requires a minimum of *WordPress 4.9*, *Groups 2.5* and *CiviCRM 5.8*.

### WordPress Users

By default, this plugin does not create a WordPress User when a CiviCRM Contact is added to a CiviCRM Group which is synced to a *Groups* Group. If you wish to do so, use a callback from the `civicrm_groups_sync_user_id_get_by_contact_id` filter to create a new WordPress User and return the User ID.

### CiviCRM Contacts

By default, this plugin does not create a CiviCRM Contact when a WordPress User is added to a *Groups* Group which is synced to a CiviCRM Group. If you wish to do so, use a callback from the `civicrm_groups_sync_contact_id_get_by_user_id` filter to create a new CiviCRM Contact and return the Contact ID.

### BuddyPress compatibility

If you are using both *BuddyPress* and *Groups* then you will also need [this plugin](https://github.com/itthinx/groups-buddypress-compatibility) in order to prevent conflicts between the two identically-named actions in these plugins.

### Permissions Sync

It may be useful to sync the capabilities/permissions using [CiviCRM Permissions Sync](https://develop.tadpole.cc/plugins/civicrm-permissions-sync)  Details are in the [README.md file](https://develop.tadpole.cc/plugins/civicrm-permissions-sync/-/blob/master/README.md)
